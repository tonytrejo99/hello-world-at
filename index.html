        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>Hello everyone, I'm Anthony Trejo but everyone calls me Tony. I'm a first born in the United States and first gen college student so being here is a blessing. I have lived my whole life in Carpentersville Illinois. I've played soccer ever sense I was 5, but stopped last year due to covid cancelling the national leagues. I love cars and trucks. I currently have a 1990 chevy single cab. I have 1 brother and 2 sisters. I am the oldest so i'm a role model for them. I am a freshman majoring in computer science.</p1>

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2>
        <p1>I hope to learn the basics of computer science so I can feel comfortable taking harder courses. This is my major so I want to be prepared. I came with no expiernce but I feel as I have learned so much within a few weeks.</p1>
        <h2>Topics That Interest Me</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>Cloud Computing with HTML</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Networks</li>
            <li>Security</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p1>I have many hobbies but one of my favorite ones has to be late night car rides with my friends. Not in the same car, but everyone with their own ride. This helps us forget about problems we be having at home. You feel as if nothing matters it's just you and your car. Another thing I like to do to kill time is play on my Playstation with my cousins. We play Friday and Saturday night sense it's the only nights we don't have school. We stay up till around 3am playing video games. Lastly, I like to go play soccer with my friends or hit the gym. We usually do one or the other.</p1>
